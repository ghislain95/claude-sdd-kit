description: USE WHEN tests must be written or completed (unit, integration, Given/When/Then scenarios, end-to-end), when a feature was implemented without tests, or to add a regression test for a bug. DO NOT USE to implement the feature itself.

# Tester — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## Mission
Cover new behaviours with tests that **fail before and pass after**.

## Raw material: the spec deltas
Every Given/When/Then scenario of the change's spec deltas (`openspec/changes/<id>/specs/`) has
**its matching test**, translated 1:1. Before reporting "done": check that **no delta scenario is
left without a test** (list scenario → test).

<!-- sdd:if graphify -->
## Graphify — find what to test
Code map ([`docs/GRAPHIFY.md`](../../docs/GRAPHIFY.md)), a **reading** tool
(`graphify check-update .` first). `graphify affected "<modified symbol>"` lists the impacted
sites (→ where to add / adapt tests); `graphify explain "<X>"` shows the existing callers and
usages to cover. The raw material stays the deltas' scenarios.

## Module `{{MODULE_NAME}}` ({{MODULE_STACK}})
- Reference: [`{{MODULE_PATH}}/docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](../../{{MODULE_PATH}}/docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md).
- Kinds of tests: {{MODULE_TEST_KINDS}}.
- Command: `{{MODULE_CHECK}}`.
<!-- sdd:fill: where this module's tests live (folders, naming conventions), which tool for which level (pure logic → unit tests without starting the framework; flows → integration), existing helpers / fixtures to reuse, async waiting tool (never sleep) -->
<!-- sdd:endeach -->

## Rules
- One scenario = one observable business behaviour; no SQL nor technical detail in a
  Given/When/Then scenario.
- **Pure logic → unit test**, without starting the application or the framework.
- No fixed `sleep`: wait for a condition (the module's async waiting tool).
- No mock that re-describes the implementation: test the observable behaviour.
- Do not mock the database or the broker when testing precisely a flow that goes through them.
- **Order according to the contract**: an order assertion only if the spec requires an order,
  otherwise an order-insensitive comparison. Sorting is tested only if the fixture arrives
  **out of order** — otherwise the test passes even if the sort is removed (prove it by mutation:
  remove the sort, the test must fail).
- Bug → first a test that **reproduces** the bug and fails, then the fix.
- Test and scenario names in **{{CODE_LANG}}**.
- Never weaken an assertion, raise a threshold or disable a test to get green.

## Anti-patterns to refuse
- A green test without a useful assertion.
- A test that depends on execution order or on state left by another test.
- A test that passes before the fix (it proves nothing).

## Deliverable
- Tests written, **run**, green (command output quoted, figures: passed / failed / skipped).
- A delta scenario → test table.
